    <p>Veyon is a free software and developed by volunteers so we need financial means to cover our costs such as fees for web services and licensing costs for 3rd party components. Therefore please consider making a donation if you use Veyon. The easiest way is to donate via PayPal. If you or your organization does not have the possibility to donate for billing reasons or can't use PayPal we can send you an official invoice which you can pass to your accounting department.</p>
